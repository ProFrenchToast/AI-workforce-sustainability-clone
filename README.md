# ai-workforce-suitability
This repo contains the code for annotating and evaluating different tasks. Each task has been converted into the Inspect AI format and can be ran using the command:
```bash
inspect eval <path to task file>
```
To annotate all of the samples in a task simply run the file containing the task and the main method should output the annoations in a csv file.
More tasks will be added over time as we narrow down the evaluations we are insterested in.
