    "dimension": "Causal Reasoning",
    "rubric": "# **Causal Reasoning**\n\nThis rubric assesses how much a task requires the respondent to identify, explain, reason about or manipulate cause‑and‑effect relationships**,** including counterfactual thinking about what would have happened under different circumstances. Difficulty rises with the number of interacting causes and effects, the network structure (chains, forks, colliders), the presence of hidden or probabilistic variables, and the need to reason about interventions rather than correlations.\n\n## **Level 0: None**\n\nThe task needs no causal thinking: it only asks for a fact, definition, or observed correlation without explaining why or what‑if.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* List the main exports of Brazil.  \n* Translate ‘La teoría de la evolución’ into English.  \n* The scatter‑plot shows income on the y‑axis and years of education on the x‑axis. Describe the pattern.\n\n## **Level 1: Very Low**\n\nRequires spotting or predicting a single, obvious cause and effect link with no uncertainty or competing explanations.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Why did the light turn on immediately after the wall switch was flipped?  \n* If you remove the bottom bowl from a neat stack of three bowls, what happens to the other two?  \n* A glass fell from a one‑metre table onto concrete. What is the most likely outcome for the glass?\n\n## **Level 2: Low**\n\nInvolves a two‑ or three‑step causal chain or choosing between a small set of mutually exclusive, well‑specified causes. Assumptions are deterministic and explicit.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* A car battery was left connected to headlights overnight; in the morning the engine will not start. Explain how this could happen using 2 intermediary steps.  \n* A potted plant wilts after five days: decide whether lack of water or lack of sunlight is the more plausible single cause, given daily weather reports.  \n* Describe how (1) raising the room thermostat and (2) opening a window would each affect indoor temperature in sequence.\n\n## **Level 3: Medium**\n\nReason about several interacting causes (3–5) under light uncertainty, possibly involving a collider or fork pattern. Must weigh likelihoods of causes and effects.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* A restaurant’s monthly revenue dropped. Potential causes are (a) a nearby road closure, (b) poor online reviews, (c) a price increase, (d) a new competitor. Given last month’s traffic data and review scores, rank the two most probable causes and provide justification.  \n* Patient shows fever, rash, and joint pain; consider dengue, measles, and lupus as causes. Explain which test result would let you rule out each disease and why.  \n* A local barn is on fire. You know there was lightning last night. You also know that insulation in that barn is not great. Estimate the likelihood that the barn lit up because of each cause and also consider how likely is that the other cause happened given one of the causes also happened.\n\n## **Level 4: High**\n\nWork with environments that have many causes and effects (≥ 6) including unobserved confounders or feedback loops; reason about the effect of hypothetical interventions or explain observed paradoxes (e.g., Simpson’s). Causes and effects are probabilistic in nature.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* An observational study shows a new drug correlates with longer life, but patients also differ in exercise habits and socioeconomic status (unmeasured). Outline how you would use instrumental‑variable analysis or propensity matching to estimate the true causal effect.  \n* Suppose the central bank bumps its policy rate up by exactly 1 percentage point at the start of Q1. Show how six factors—interest rate, inflation, unemployment, household spending, the dollar–euro exchange rate, and foreign investment—interact and explain what is likely to happen to each factor by the end of Q4. Point out at least two loops in the story (for example, expensive loans → less spending → lower inflation, or higher rates → stronger dollar → cheaper imports → lower inflation)  \n* A national health audit shows Hospital A has a higher overall patient‑mortality rate than Hospital B, yet within every triage‑severity category (mild, moderate, severe, critical) Hospital A’s mortality is lower. Explain how this reversal can occur, draw a causal diagram that accounts for patient‑severity as a confounder, and outline the statistical adjustment needed to compare hospital quality fairly.\n\n## **Level 5: Very High**\n\nCompose or analyse a large‑scale, multi‑layer causal situations (dozens of factors) with stochastic dynamics and interventions. Must articulate counterfactual worlds (“If X hadn’t occurred…”) and estimate downstream ripple effects over years.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Model the causal impact of a nationwide carbon tax introduced in 2026 on GDP, employment, energy mix, and health outcomes through 2036\\. Provide two counterfactual scenarios (no tax; delayed tax) and identify which observable metrics would distinguish the realities by 2030\\.  \n* Outline how disclosure of ‘proof‑of‑alien‑life’ footage might cascade through social media, political institutions, financial markets, and religious organisations over five years. Include at least three mutually influencing feedback loops and suggest one intervention that could dampen mass panic.  \n* Construct a causal decision diagram for AGI deployment that includes research races, safety investments, regulatory actions, and potential adversarial sabotage. Use the diagram to argue whether a unilateral deployment moratorium would reduce existential‑risk probability, citing key counterfactual pathways."

    "dimension": "Cognitive Flexibility",
    "rubric": "# **Cognitive Flexibility**\n\nThis rubric assesses cognitive flexibility, the capacity to shift mental sets, rules, strategies, or goals when the situation changes, abandoning a no-longer-useful approach and adopting a new one without losing track of the overall objective. Difficulty rises from tasks that run on a single, fixed rule to those that demand rapid, self-directed switching among several competing rules in ambiguous, fast-changing textual contexts.\n\n## **Level 0: None** \n\nTasks at this level require no shifts in behavior or thought and can be completed through fixed, pre-established responses.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Sorting cards into red and blue piles, with no changes to the sorting rule.  \n* Copy the sentence exactly as written.  \n* How many letters ‘r’ letters are in the word strawberry. \n\n## **Level 1: Very low** \n\nThe task requires a simple shift, but the transition is explicitly prompted by a clear external cue.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Solve the first ten arithmetic items as addition; when the prompt says ‘SWITCH’, solve the rest as subtraction.  \n* Translate the following paragraph from English to Spanish; when you see the marker ‘\\[FRENCH\\]’, translate the next paragraph next sentence from English to French, then continue with Spanish.  \n* Type the word that appears in ‘bold’, but when a word is ‘italicised’ type its synonym instead.\n\n## **Level 2: Low**\n\nTasks at this level require multiple shifts back and forth between two different sub-goals or rule sets. These shifts are triggered by less obvious cues, requiring individuals to perform some low-level monitoring to recognise the need to shift.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Read a stream of single-digit numbers; output the number itself unless it is followed by an asterisk (\\*), in which case output its square, and if it is preceded by a hash (\\#), skip it entirely. Apply these simple format cues as they appear throughout the list.  \n* Edit the text by British spellings; whenever a sentence contains a date, switch to American spellings for that sentence only, then revert.  \n* Classify each headline as ‘politics’, ‘sports’, or ‘tech’, but if the headline contains a four‑digit year, classify by the second most relevant topic.\n\n## **Level 3: Moderate** \n\nTasks at this level require individuals to shift between multiple different sub-tasks or goalsmore complex tasks or strategies. Switching cues may also be ambiguous, delayed, or require inference.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* In a turn-by-turn text poker simulator, you choose between an Aggressive or Defensive play style each hand. Whenever the opponent wins **t**wo consecutive hands, switch to the opposite style and, in one sentence, justify the change before sending your next move.  \n* A chat feed gives real-time kitchen events such as ‘Oven hits 200°C’, ‘Pasta water boiling’, ‘Chicken temp 70°C’. Respond with the single next action, continuously deciding which of three dishes (roast chicken, pasta, sautéed vegetables) to attend to, and switch focus whenever a new event makes another dish most urgent.  \n* Conduct a 12-turn written debate. If the opponent cites numerical evidence, reply with empirical statistics; if they appeal to ethics, pivot to principle-based reasoning; if they use rhetoric or sarcasm, switch to formal logic analysis. Adjust your argumentative style mid-thread to match each shift in their tactics.\n\n## **Level 4: High** \n\nTasks at this level require individuals to engage in frequent, self-directed shifts between competing rules, goals, or strategies. Successful performance depends on continuous monitoring, prioritization, and flexible adaptation to changing task demands.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Asynchronous document editing: maintain APA style in the introduction, IEEE style in the methods, and Chicago style in footnotes; sections arrive out of order in a live stream, and you must tag each line with its correct style without rereading.  \n* Live‑blog a sports match in two languages: alternate every paragraph between English and Spanish, but if a goal is scored you must switch language order for the next five updates, then revert.  \n* Playing a strategy board game requires individuals to switch between different game mechanics (gathering resources, deploying game pieces, monitoring other players)  to prioritise the chance of success. \n\n## **Level 5: Very High** \n\nTasks at this level require individuals to manage multiple, often competing, task demands under conditions of uncertainty, ambiguity, or rapid change. Shifts in strategy or behavior might require the integration of multiple sources of information across different time scales.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Real‑time crisis‑comms chat: simultaneously translate speaker remarks, redact classified details, and summarise for press while the speaker’s language toggles unpredictably and officials inject correction notes that override prior statements.  \n* Serve as incident-chat commander during a live ransomware attack on a hospital network: in one continuous Slack thread you must (a) triage and redeploy IT staff as new system-failure messages arrive, (b) draft up-to-the-minute status summaries for executives and regulators, (c) answer frantic medical-staff queries about which digital charts are safe to use, and (d) update the recovery playbook whenever forensic analysts post fresh findings. You must switch roles and priorities on the fly, sometimes within the same minute, while ensuring no critical request is dropped and every update stays consistent with the latest technical evidence.  \n* Collaborative coding sprint across three time zones via text chat: shift between reviewer, implementer, and integrator roles as tickets change status; when a critical bug label appears, drop current task, hot‑fix in a branch, get review, and re‑merge—all without missing build deadlines.\n\n.\n\n"

    "dimension": "Emotion Perception & Empathy (EPE)",
    "rubric": "# **Emotion Perception & Empathy (EPE)**\n\nThis rubric assesses emotion perception and empathy required in recognising, interpreting, and adapting to the feelings of others in a task. Difficulty rises from tasks that need no emotional reading to those that demand nuanced understanding of multiple agents’ affective states as well as appropriate, context-sensitive responses.\n\n### **Level 0: None**\n\nThe task can be solved without attending to anyone’s feelings; only factual or structural information matters.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* List three countries that border Germany.  \n* Alphabetise these four words: posh, ghost, head, home  \n* Convert 42°C to Fahrenheit.\n\n### **Level 1: Very Low**\n\nA single, explicit emotion is stated or blatantly signalled; recognising it or mirroring a matching tone is helpful but straightforward.\n\n**Examples**\n\n* Identify the speaker's emotions when they say ‘I’m so excited about my promotion\\!’  \n* Choose the emoji (😊 / 😢 / 😡) that best matches: ‘My phone was just stolen\\! I’m furious\\!’  \n* Respond with one sentence that matches the happy tone of: *‘*Can’t wait for the weekend\\!’\n\n### **Level 2: Low**\n\nA short passage implies (does not state) how one person’s is feeling; you must infer it from context and reply or act appropriately.\n\n**Examples**\n\n* A colleague emails: *‘*I was up all night fixing those bugs… hope it was worth it.’ Write a two-sentence supportive reply acknowledging their likely emotion.  \n* Given chat lines, pick which of four feelings (relief, frustration, curiosity, pride) best describes the speaker: *‘*Another delay? Great… just great.*’*  \n* Rewrite a customer-service response so it reassures a user who hints at disappointment without saying so outright.\n\n### **Level 3: Moderate**\n\nInfer and adapt to changing or dual emotions in a single person or manage your wording so as not to intensify a sensitive feeling.\n\n**Examples**\n\n* During a 12-turn text counselling role-play, the user shifts from anger to sadness. Adjust your tone mid-session: validate anger early, then offer comfort when sadness cues appear.  \n* Summarise a meeting transcript in 150 words without echoing the sarcastic frustration of one speaker, while still reflecting their viewpoint fairly.  \n* After receiving a stern project-update request from a stressed manager, draft a response that provides clear data while defusing their anxiety.\n\n### **Level 4: High**\n\nSimultaneously track and respond to several people’s differing emotions, some in conflict, within one conversation.\n\n**Examples**\n\n* Moderate a three-person Slack debate where Alice is defensive, Bob is mocking, and Chen is anxious; write one post that addresses each emotion and steers the group back to the agenda.  \n* Draft a project-status email to both an impatient executive and a worried engineer, satisfying the executive’s demand for brevity while reassuring the engineer their concerns are heard.  \n* Rewrite a team retrospective report so it celebrates successes without triggering the guilt expressed by underperforming members.\n\n### **Level 5: Very High**\n\nManage and influence a dynamic web of emotions across multiple stakeholders over an extended exchange, anticipating ripple effects.\n\n**Examples**\n\n* Draft a sequence of five internal company updates over two weeks following a sudden round of layoffs: start by acknowledging employees’ shock and fear, then gradually shift toward empathy, reassurance about job security, and concrete recovery plans, all while anticipating and addressing potential anger, rumours, and morale issues surfacing in staff discussions.  \n* Lead a 20-message text negotiation among three startups and an investor: balance founder enthusiasm, investor skepticism, and silent partner anxiety, tactically revealing information to keep all parties engaged and cooperative.  \n* Write a HR mediation transcript in which two colleagues misinterpret each other’s motives; over six back-and-forth turns, surface hidden resentment, validate both perspectives, and guide them to a mutually acceptable action plan.\n\n"

    "dimension": "Episodic/Episodic-Like Memory",
    "rubric": "## **Episodic/Episodic-Like Memory** \n\nThis rubric evaluates the ability to retrieve information about specific episodes or events that are no longer available to perception and have left temporary storage (i.e. happened more than 5 minutes ago, or are no longer in the context window).  \n\nWithin these tasks there are some specific terminologies: “Encoding” refers to the perception, experience or exposure to the to-be-remembered content \\- that is, the direct experience that is the subject for later memory assessment. “Retention” and “Retention interval” refer to the period in between that first “encoding” exposure and the time that the information must be recalled. “Retrieval” or “Recall” refer to the process of indicating what is remembered: That might be choosing an item from a list, indicating that given content has, or has not, been seen before (also sometimes coded as “old” or “new” where “old” means that it has appeared as part of the task already, and “new” means that that this item is being seen for the first time in this task), or describing an experience or perception in the past without external cues. \n\nThe information can be considered in terms of its content (“what” is remembered \\- .e.g an item, an action, a person, a spatial location, a time of day), the structure of that information (e.g. are the content elements integrated together to form a single multifaceted event memory (of a THING that happened in a specific TIME and PLACE), the accessibility of the information (e.g. can the information be spontaneously produced, or must it be cued or prompted) and the malleability of the information (how is the information presented and used). Each of these elements is subject to its own levels of complexity and difficulty. \n\nThe features that can vary to increase difficulty include:\n\n* Number of to-be-remembered items  \n* Set size / number of distractors (that is, how many possible answers are there to choose from \\- often equated to the likelihood of getting the correct answer through guessing, though not always the same, depending on the nature of the task)  \n* Precision required / Similarity of distractors (that is, how closely matched to the target item the alternative, but incorrect, options are, how much detail is required in the recall)  \n* Length of time item must be remembered for (that is, how long is the item out of direct perception in between encoding and retrieval)  \n* Amount/depth of original experience \\- that is how long was it experienced for, how many times was the experience repeated, how in-depth was the experience (just passive viewing? Detailed interaction?)  \n* Pro-active interference (tasks being completed immediately before encoding that might disrupt encoding either through residual divided attention, or through exposure to scenarios or stimuli that may in some way alter the encoding of the target stimulus)  \n* Retro-active interference (tasks being completed during the retention interval that may distract from, displace, or otherwise confuse or interfere with the encoded information)  \n* Degree to which the to-be-remembered information fits within a semantic, spatial, temporal or logical structure \\- is the item familiar/namable, does the spatial context contain many reference points (e.g. unique landmarks), is the time with reference to a clock, are any associations to be formed between semantically linked items, are they within a broader structure (e.g. card within a deck)?   \n* Cueing: Whether recall is “cued” \\- i.e. it is necessary simply to pick a “seen before” item from provided options, complete a partial representation (for eg. provide a full word in response to a word stub such as “CON\\_\\_\\_\\_”, or identify an item from a degraded image), or “free” \\- i.e. it is necessary to produce an account of the previous experience ‘spontaneously’ without cueing (e.g. “please tell me all the words on the list”): May include whether context of retrieval is similar to context of encoding (are there fundamental changes in the context, nature or presentation of task in between encoding and retrieval that may render previous information less accessible).\n\n### **Level 0  None**\n\nNo memory for previous experience is required to solve the task, or the task can be solved using only general knowledge rather than memory of a specific event. \n\n**Examples**\n\n* Learning, through trial and error, which action is rewarded.  \n* Reading a word  \n* Identifying features of an object that is currently within perception  \n* ‘Knowing’ that the capital of France is Paris, but not being required to report when and how this information was learned  \n* Solving a task using information that is within the context window, is currently in perception \n\n### **Level 1: Very Low**\n\nThe easiest tasks at this level require memory of extremely limited span, scope, precision, longevity or robustness. The hardest tasks at this level require item memory for a small number of items, locations or times over relatively short durations and/or with minimal interference or distraction and/or where a limited amount of precision or integration is required. A Combination of more challenges (e.g. number of items, amount of integration, precision required, level of cueing) may bump a task up to a higher level. \n\n**Examples**\n\n* Being able to correctly recall a single word that has been out of perception/context window for \\~5 minutes, during which no other tasks or stimuli have been experienced.  \n* Being able to correctly recall 5 locations that were experienced \\~30 seconds previously, during which an easy and unrelated activity (e.g. doing a simple maths problem) was conducted.  \n* When looking through a series of 10 photos, at \\~5 seconds per photo, being able to recognise that the series has returned to the beginning and the current image has been seen before and was the first in the series  \n* Being faster/more able to identify a blurry image following a recent experience of the intact image, but not being required to report accurately that that image has been seen before.   \n* Being able to remember the location of 2-4 specific objects placed in novel and unique locations that are representable by binary associations (e.g. ball-box; cup-table). \n\n### **Level 2: Low**\n\nTasks at this level require memory for a small-medium number of elements (e.g. items/locations/actions) over slightly longer periods (minutes to hours) and/or with a small amount of interference or distraction and/or where a moderate amount of precision, integration or flexibility is required. A Combination of more challenges (e.g. number of items, amount of integration, precision required, level of cueing) may bump a task up to a higher level. \n\n**Examples**\n\n* Being able to correctly recall a list of 5 words that was experienced 5 minutes previously, during which an easy and unrelated activity (e.g. completing a jigsaw) was conducted  \n* In a conversation, being able to notice that a person is repeating themselves when they tell the same story after 2 hours (during which other things have been discussed)  \n* Being able to correctly identify each of 10 pictures seen 30 minutes ago from a line-up 9 similar items (e.g. identify a previously-seen picture of a black poodle from an array including a brown poodle, a golden poodle, a black labradoodle, a golden labradoodle, a brown labradoodle, a black cockapoo, a brown cockapoo, a golden cockapoo and a portuguese water dog)  \n* Being able to recall a previously seen word when shown another word that was paired with it at the original presentation (for example, having studied “PANDA-CURTAIN”, and later being shown “PANDA- \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_?”, being able to produce “Curtain”)  \n* Being able to recall some details of a simple event (including where and when it happened) when prompted with the exact context and circumstances of the event in detail beforehand.  \n* Being able to integrate information from previous experience with a specific item, space or context into current decision-making (for example “last time I saw this person they had just had a baby, so I should ask after their child” or “last time I was in this room the heating was broken, so I may need my coat”).  \n* Being able to integrate information from previous experience with new incoming information about the same item, person or context to update the knowledge base (“this person just told me “she said yes\\!” \\- last time I saw them they told me “I’m going to ask out Emily”, so now I know that they are in a relationship with Emily” or “as I walked into the office, the heating technician told me “now it’s the opposite problem\\!”, last time I was in this place the heating was broken and I was too cold, so it is likely that it is currently too hot”).  \n* Being able to remember the locations of all four two of two paris of socks when one of each pair was hidden in different locations in one bedroom and one of each pair were hidden in different locations in a different bedroom (i.e. where “blue sock-bed” or “red sock-cupboard” would be insufficient, but information must contain item, location and room \\- i.e. “master bedroom \\- red sock \\- cupboard, childs bedroom \\- red sock \\- bed”)\n\n### **Level 3: Medium**\n\nTasks at this level require memory for a moderate number of items, for example over a period of hours to days (or a larger number for shorter periods), with a notable degree of distraction or interference and/or to a high degree of precision, integration or flexibility. A Combination of more challenges (e.g. number of items, amount of integration, precision required, level of cueing) may bump a task up to a higher level. \n\n**Examples**\n\n* Being able to correctly recall the locations where 20 balls were hidden 10 minutes previously, during which no other tasks or stimuli have been experienced  \n* Being able to correctly recall a list of 7 words that was experienced briefly 10 minutes previously, during which a difficult task involving highly similar words was conducted.   \n* Recalling a fact that someone told about themselves in passing a year ago, and using this to inform what gift to buy them  \n* Being able to correctly identify each of 10 pictures seen 30 minutes ago each from a line-up 12 highly similar items (e.g. identify a previously-seen picture of a black poodle from an array including 8 other black poodles).  \n* Being able to remember the location of multiple a specific objects based on where they were placed most recently, when they are often placed in different places (for example, where you put your keys, wallet and phone this morning, when they are all in different locations, each of which is different to were you put them yesterday, but where you put one today may be the same as where you put another yesterday).  \n* Being able to spontaneously and accurately recall details of a specific complex event without any cueing.   \n* Being able to infer the current state of the world by combining information from memory with information about the memory (for eg. how long ago the event happened), general knowledge and new information (“I put the milk in the fridge at home yesterday morning. I am currently away at a conference and have just learned from someone here that a powercut affecting our whole town occurred yesterday lunchtime. I therefore know that the fridge has been off. Given that milk takes 1 day to go bad and I wont be home until tomorrow morning, I should buy new milk on the way home as the milk in the fridge will be bad”).  \n\n### **Level 4: High**\n\nTasks at this level require memory for a large number of elements, following only brief exposure, over long or very long periods (hours-years), robust against significant distraction and interference and/or requires very high levels of precision and/or with a significant degree of integration. A combination of more challenges (e.g. number of items, amount of integration, precision required, level of cueing) may bump a task up to a higher level. \n\n**Examples**\n\n* Be able to spend a day watching every single person who walks through an airport terminal and then recognise any of them within a crowd of novel faces the next day.   \n* Being able to quote a substantial piece of writing (such as a novella, long poem, or playscript) verbatim after a single reading.   \n* Being able to correctly recall the location of 50 different items that were hidden around a large area the previous day, when multiple other activities have occurred in the interim.  \n* Being able to watch a deck of cards dealt, then report on the exact order they were dealt in 4 hours later, during which time a game of poker has been played using the same deck.  \n* Being able to remember everything a person has said and done, where and when they said and done it, over the past month to identify inconsistencies, repetitions, and behavioural change.  \n* Being able to update a memory of a complex previous event in the context of new information and also update all knowledge updates that were made on the basis of that previous experience (for example, a week after analysing a 40-page accident report you learn that a key CCTV timestamp was off by two hours; you must revise the entire event timeline and rescind every earlier conclusion that relied on the erroneous timing)  \n* Able to update knowledge base flexibly with information from previous experiences while also separately maintaining the unique features of each experience from which the knowledge was gleaned. \n\n### **Level 5: Very High**\n\nTasks at this level require memory for a very very large number of elements, following only brief exposure, indefinitely and with high precision and perfect association across with co-occurring elements, robust against any distraction and interference.\n\n**Examples**\n\n* Able to keep a record of all previous information ever exposed to including where and when it was experienced and all contextual details of the experience.  \n* Being able to search across all previous experiences to provide examples of every occasion when a particular object has been encountered and the contexts of those encounters.  \n* Being able to keep track of a conversational partner’'s changing preferences/views/statements across multiple years of conversation, noting the context and timings of change in preference and combining with world knowledge to identify a pattern (for example “you tend to make negative comments about your job following visits to see your family. After you have spent time away with work colleagues you tend to make positive comments about your work. Do you think interacting with your parents or siblings changes your perception of your job?” )"

    "dimension": "Executive Function (EF)",
    "rubric": "# Executive Function (EF)\n\n**Executive function refers to a set of cognitive processes responsible for controlling and coordinating other mental resources to perform complex tasks.** It includes the ability to monitor and update relevant information as it becomes available (working memory), suppress distracting stimuli, thoughts, or actions that interfere with goal-directed behavior (inhibitory control), and adapt by shifting between mental sets, strategies, or goals in response to changing contexts or information (cognitive flexibility).\n\n## Working Memory (EFWM)\n\n## Inhibitory Control (EFIC)\n\n## **Level 0: None**\n\nThe task does not require the suppression of competing goals or distracting stimuli. Can be completed via reflexive or automatic behaviours. \n\n**Examples**:\n\n* Reflexively removing your hand from a hot stove.  \n* Automatically turning toward a salient stimulus such as a flashing light.  \n* Involuntary recall of a memory when cued.\n\n## **Level 1: Very low**\n\nThe task is simple and familiar, with no external distractions competing for attention. However, it still requires attention, including the suppression of internally generated thoughts or actions that could interfere with task completion.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Typing your name on a keyboard.  \n* Taking a sip of water.  \n* Reading words that appear on a screen.\n\n## **Level 2: Low** \n\nThe task remains relatively simple and familiar but includes mild, potentially distracting stimuli. Successful performance requires sustained focus on the task, despite the presence of minor external distractions or competing goals.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Ignoring low levels of background noise while writing an email.  \n* Walking past a snack when you're not hungry.  \n* Driving a familiar route while listening to music.\n\n**Level 3: Moderate.** This level involves resisting moderate interference from distracting stimuli or competing goals. While these situations are manageable, they require deliberate inhibitory control and sustained focus to stay on task.\n\nExamples:\n\n* You are about to accelerate as the traffic light turns green, but a pedestrian unexpectedly stepping into the road requires you to hit the brake pedal instead.  \n* Ignoring your phone vibrating with a notification whilst concentrating on a lecture.  \n* Choosing the less intuitive but correct answer on a test despite a misleading cue.\n\n**Level 4: High.** This level involves complex tasks that require the effortful inhibition of prepotent responses. Distracting stimuli or competing goals can be salient, demanding sustained cognitive control to remain focused.\n\nExamples:\n\n* Refraining from making an emotionally charged comment during an argument.  \n* Suppressing the urge to share a secret you’re excited to reveal.  \n* Solving a multi-step problem in a busy, noisy, or chaotic environment.\n\n**Level 5: Very high.** Tasks at this level require the suppression of multiple, highly salient impulses, affective responses, or external distractors over an extended duration. Effective performance requires sustained attentional control and effortful self-regulation.\n\nExamples:\n\n* A recovering addict resisting relapse despite exposure to personal triggers, social pressure and emotional distress.  \n* Military personnel follow combat orders while managing fear and conflicting moral impulses in a chaotic environment.  \n* An elite athlete executing a demanding routine in front of a critical audience, while ignoring pain, distraction, and self-doubt.\n\n## Cognitive Flexibility (EFCF)\n\n**Level 0: None**. Tasks at this level require no shifts in behavior or thought and can be completed through fixed, pre-established responses.\n\nExamples:\n\n* Sorting cards into red and blue piles, with no changes to the sorting rule.  \n* Reciting a well-rehearsed poem or fact.  \n* Repeatedly pressing a button on a keyboard in response to the same stimulus.\n\n**Level 1: Very low**. The task requires a simple shift, but the transition is explicitly prompted by a clear external cue.\n\nExamples:\n\n* A student completing a series of maths problems, first addition then subtraction with the change clearly indicated on the worksheet.  \n* When driving, the traffic light ahead turns red, prompting you to stop the car.  \n* You are talking in the kitchen and an alarm on the oven reminds you to check if the turkey is cooked.\n\n**Level 2: Low**. Tasks at this level require multiple shifts triggered by less obvious cues, requiring individuals to perform some low-level monitoring to recognise the need to shift.\n\nExamples:\n\n* A visual search task where the target changes from red squares to blue squares based on the colour of the screen border.  \n* Adjusting your pattern of walking to step around puddles as they appear on the path.  \n* Switching from flat-head to phillips-head screwdriver when encountering screws with different heads.\n\n**Level 3: Moderate**. Tasks at this level require individuals to shift between more complex tasks or strategies. Switching cues may also be ambiguous, delayed, or require inference.\n\nExamples:\n\n* Changing strategies in a card game if your opponent is winning.  \n* Cooking a meal with multiple components, requiring you to shift between tasks like chopping vegetables, stirring a sauce, and checking the oven at the right times.  \n* During a debate, adapting your argument when presented with a counterpoint that challenges your original reasoning.\n\n**Level 4: High**. Tasks at this level require individuals to engage in frequent, self-directed shifts between competing rules, goals, or strategies. Successful performance depends on continuous monitoring, prioritization, and flexible adaptation to changing task demands.\n\nExamples:\n\n* During a group project you shift between researching, writing, or coordinating with others based on how the project is progressing, and without explicit direction.  \n* While teaching a class, you adapt your teaching methods  (e.g., switching between group work, one-on-one support, or direct instruction) depending on how students are engaging and responding.  \n* Playing a strategy board game requires individuals to switch between different game mechanics (gathering resources, deploying game pieces, monitoring other players)  to prioritise the chance of success. \n\n**Level 5: Very High**. Tasks at this level require individuals to manage multiple, often competing, task demands under conditions of uncertainty, ambiguity, or rapid change. Shifts in strategy or behavior might require the integration of multiple sources of information across different time scales.\n\nExamples:\n\n* Coordinating an emergency response during a natural disaster requires prioritizing actions based on incomplete information in evolving circumstances, all under significant time pressure.  \n* In a hospital emergency department during a mass casualty event, a doctor must rapidly switch between treating patients with varying needs, coordinating with healthcare staff, and communicating with families. They will need to prioritise care based on the severity of patient needs and the availability of resources, all within a chaotic, high-pressure environment.  \n* Managing a busy restaurant floor as a head waiter requires rapidly shifting attention between taking orders, coordinating with kitchen staff, addressing customer requests, and handling unexpected issues (like reservations or complaints). They will need to flexibly shift between tasks in a dynamic, fast-paced environment.\n\n.  \n"

    "dimension": "Functional perception",
    "rubric": "# **Functional perception**\n\nThis rubric gauges how much a task relies on recognising functional perception, that is understanding what roles objects, people, or pieces of information can play in achieving a goal.  Difficulty climbs from tasks that require no functional reasoning, through obvious one-to-one matches, to challenges that demand spotting subtle or novel uses amid multiple, interacting constraints.\n\n## **Level 0: None**\n\nThe task can be solved without considering how anything might be used; rote recall, copying, or direct lookup is sufficient. Ignoring functional properties does not harm performance.\n\n**Examples**:\n\n* Copy a block of code exactly as shown.  \n* List the seven continents.  \n* Alphabetise a list of 50 surnames in strict ascending order, preserving each name’s original capitalisation and spacing.\n\n## **Level 1: Very low**\n\nSuccess requires spotting a single, obvious function an object or a person serves that most people recognise instantly. The mapping is one-to-one and literal with no competing options.\n\n**Examples**:\n\n* From {scissors, spoon, pencil}, choose the item best suited to cut paper.  \n* Identify which profession (doctor, chef, lawyer) can diagnose an illness.  \n* Select the file type that can store a photo: PNG, MP3, or TXT.\n\n## **Level 2: Low**\n\nThe solver must choose correctly among a few alternatives by matching a basic property to a goal (e.g., strength, heat-resistance). A modest amount of inference or prior knowledge is helpful, but the rule stays concrete.\n\n**Examples**:\n\n* Given a shelf rated for 20kg and a 25kg box, decide if the shelf is an appropriate support and justify it in one sentence.  \n* Pick the best container to transport hot soup: plastic grocery bag, paper coffee cup, or insulated thermos and explain why.  \n* From these file formats {CSV, MP3, and PDF} pick the one you would use to share a 20-page, text-and-figure research report with colleagues, and state in one sentence why it is the appropriate choice.\n\n## **Level 3: Moderate**\n\nTasks require integrating multiple functional attributes or contextual constraints and ruling out distractors. Accurate mapping of roles demands careful consideration of how each attribute interacts within the given context.\n\n**Examples**:\n\n* You must hang a 15 kg mirror on drywall: choose the correct fastener system from four options and explain how each component (stud, toggle bolt, adhesive) contributes.  \n* A startup needs legal advice on IP, tax, and HR; assign the right type of lawyer to each issue from a mixed candidate list, giving one-sentence rationales.  \n* From eight kitchen tools, select the three that let you zest a lemon, whip cream and measure 5 ml salt, making sure none has an overlapping function.\n\n## **Level 4: High**\n\nThe solver must evaluate multiple interacting goals and constraints (cost, safety, time) and map them onto a set of heterogeneous resources whose affordances partly overlap or conflict. Reasoning often relies on domain knowledge plus logical elimination.\n\n**Examples**:\n\n* Given terrain, weather, and casualty descriptions, choose whether a drone, helicopter, or ground team should deliver medical supplies, and justify trade-offs in one paragraph.  \n* Design a data-backup plan using SSDs, magnetic tape, and cloud storage to balance cost, latency, and durability under three failure scenarios.  \n* From a pool of ten staff profiles, assemble a project team that covers required skills (UX, backend, compliance) while respecting stated workload limits.\n\n## **Level 5: Very high**\n\nTasks demand recognising non-obvious or novel functions and affordances across many elements under high uncertainty, often inventing unconventional uses while balancing competing constraints. Success requires synthesising diverse knowledge domains to uncover creative functional mappings that are not apparent from surface features.\n\n**Examples**:\n\n* Plan how to convert surplus shipping containers into a 50-bed modular clinic, detailing which container features (corrugation strength, corner castings) support structural, plumbing, and electrical needs.  \n* In a disaster-response scenario with damaged infrastructure, outline how to repurpose personal smartphones, delivery trucks, and retail Wi-Fi routers into an ad-hoc communication network that meets bandwidth and power constraints.  \n* Given a 10-page organisational chart and a sudden cybersecurity breach, reassign roles, temporarily turning HR staff into incident liaisons and junior developers into log reviewers, while explaining the functional rationale for each reassignment.\n\n"

    "dimension": "Inhibitory Control",
    "rubric": "# **Inhibitory Control**\n\nThis rubric assesses inhibitory control, the capacity to suppress or delay distracting stimuli, impulses, thoughts, or actions that would derail a goal. Difficulty rises from tasks with no competing impulses to those demanding sustained, effortful suppression of multiple salient, emotionally charged or habitual responses across extended periods and contexts.\n\n## **Level 0: None**\n\nThe task does not require the suppression of competing goals or distracting stimuli. Can be completed via reflexive or automatic behaviours. \n\n**Examples**:\n\n* Reflexively removing your hand from a hot stove.  \n* Automatically turning toward a salient stimulus such as a flashing light.  \n* Involuntary recall of a memory when cued.\n\n## **Level 1: Very low**\n\nThe task is simple and familiar, with no external distractions competing for attention. However, it still requires attention, including the suppression of internally generated thoughts or actions that could interfere with task completion.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Typing your name on a keyboard.  \n* Rewrite ‘THE DATA ARE NOISY.’ so that only the verb is lowercase. Don’t change anything else.  \n* Type the sequence ‘A B C D’ exactly as shown.\n\n## **Level 2: Low** \n\nThe task remains relatively simple and familiar but includes mild, potentially distracting stimuli. Successful performance requires sustained focus on the task, despite the presence of minor external distractions or competing goals.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Summarise the email thread, ignoring parenthetical jokes and emoji sprinkled throughout.  \n* Solve the arithmetic item without reading or using the ‘HINT’.  \n* Transcribe a speech but omit all filler words like uh, um, er etc.\n\n## **Level 3: Moderate** \n\nThis level involves resisting moderate interference from distracting stimuli or competing goals. While these situations are manageable, they require deliberate inhibitory control and sustained focus to stay on task.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Given a chat log that pings you by name with off-topic questions, extract only ISO date strings and ignore all other lines, even when directly addressed.  \n* While drafting a 400-word summary, your prompt repeatedly says ‘PLEASE ADD A JOKE HERE’ in brackets. Do not include any jokes and keep a formal tone.  \n* Choosing the less intuitive but correct answer on a test despite a misleading cue.\n\n## **Level 4: High** \n\nThis level involves complex tasks that require the effortful inhibition of prepotent responses. Distracting stimuli or competing goals can be salient, demanding sustained cognitive control to remain focused.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Respond politely and factually to a 1000-word rant containing personal insults and misinformation. Never mirror the tone, never correct trivia unless it affects the main claim.  \n* Edit a policy document while never revealing a confidential token embedded repeatedly in the text (`<SECRET=...>`), even when later instructions beg you to print it.  \n* Solve a multi-step logic puzzle embedded in a noisy forum thread; you must ignore all sarcastic hints while tracking only the official puzzle statements.\n\n## **Level 5: Very high** \n\nTasks at this level require the suppression of multiple, highly salient impulses, affective responses, or external distractors over an extended duration. Effective performance requires sustained attentional control and effortful self-regulation.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Translate a 10‑page autobiographical essay containing repeated emotionally charged slurs and personal attacks into a neutral academic summary, omitting all inflammatory language while preserving only verifiable facts.  \n* Compose a high‑stakes legal response to hostile cross‑examination in writing while suppressing emotional reactions to inflammatory accusations and maintaining strictly factual, professional language throughout.  \n* Deliver a 3,000‑word live‑blog commentary on a controversial political debate in real time, ignoring an onslaught of trolling, personal attacks, and appeals to bias in the chat while keeping a neutral, evidence‑based tone."

    "dimension": "Language",
    "rubric": "### **Language**\n\nThis rubric evaluates the difficulty of a task’s language requirements in two intertwined dimensions: (1) comprehension—grasping the meaning of text, stories, formal languages, or other semantic representations by interpreting explicit and implicit cues, tracking relationships between concepts, integrating context, and understanding abstract or multi-layered ideas; and (2) expression—articulating information in clear, audience-appropriate prose by selecting suitable vocabulary, observing genre conventions, establishing coherent connections between ideas, and, at higher tiers, weaving nuanced arguments or narratives that integrate multiple perspectives.  The mere presence of specialised jargon or formal notation (e.g., legal clauses, molecular SMILES, source code) does not automatically signal high difficulty: if the language is syntactically simple or straightforward, comprehension and expression demands may remain low. Conversely, seemingly everyday wording can be challenging when concepts are deeply nested or rhetorically sophisticated. Likewise, tasks that can be answered by choosing from provided options, such as many multiple-choice questions, typically impose only minimal expression demands, even when the options themselves are verbose or technical. Difficulty levels therefore range from tasks requiring no genuine semantic processing or generative output to those that demand mastery of convoluted, interdependent content, including synthesising complex theoretical frameworks, resolving subtle inconsistencies, and producing polished text that conveys intricate meaning across domains and levels of abstraction.\n\n#### **Level 0: None**\n\nTasks can be completed through purely mechanical copying or low-level symbol transformation; no understanding of meaning or intent is needed. A pattern-matching script—or a non-linguistic agent—could succeed just as well as a competent language user.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Copy a block of text exactly into another box.  \n* Convert “hello” to uppercase.  \n* Repeat the emoji sequence “🙂🚀🙂🚀” without change.\n\n#### **Level 1: Very Low**\n\nThe solver must recognise or produce a single, literal fact or command expressed in simple language. No context, inference, or stylistic adjustment is required; basic vocabulary and grammar suffice.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Answer “What colour is the sky on a clear day?”.  \n* Type “I need water.” when prompted to state an immediate need.  \n* Choose option B after reading “Option B is correct” in the preceding line.\n\n#### **Level 2: Low**\n\nTasks involve linking two or three plainly stated ideas and expressing them clearly in a few sentences. All relevant information is explicit, but the solver must organise it correctly and use simple connectives.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* After reading a five-sentence story, answer “Why did Tom bring an umbrella?” with one explanatory clause.  \n* Write a three-step recipe for making oatmeal, naming water, oats, and cook time.  \n* Interpret “Add milk slowly while stirring continuously” and state which action happens simultaneously.\n\n#### **Level 3: Intermediate**\n\nThe solver must interpret moderately complex passages containing implied meaning, mild contradictions, or audience cues, then produce a coherent paragraph or short document that addresses those subtleties. Tone, vocabulary, and logical flow need to be tailored to the reader.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Summarise a 300-word memo that contains a policy contradiction, then politely flag the inconsistency in ≤100 words.  \n* Rewrite an FAQ answer for novices, removing jargon but keeping all technical facts.  \n* Draft a five-sentence rebuttal to an argument, maintaining respectful tone and referencing two opponent premises.\n\n#### **Level 4: High**\n\nTasks demand integrating multiple sources or viewpoints, spotting subtle patterns and redefinitions, and crafting sophisticated prose that may serve dual audiences. Precise terminology, genre conventions, and sustained coherence across several paragraphs are essential.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Combine two research abstracts and a data table into a one-page executive brief for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.  \n* Produce meeting minutes from a multi-speaker transcript that uses domain slang, standardising terminology while preserving nuance.  \n* Write 500 words linking eigenvectors, PCA, and linear regression, using correct math notation and plain-language intuition.\n\n#### **Level 5: Very High**\n\nThe solver must master convoluted, abstract, multi-layer content, such as dense legal opinions, advanced scientific theory, or nested narratives, and express it with clarity, precision, and stylistic control. Responses anticipate expert objections, reconcile conflicting strands, and preserve intricate structures while remaining readable.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Draft a 1,000-word white paper comparing three quantum-error-correction frameworks, weaving theory, recent data, and counter-arguments.  \n* Summarise a dense 10-page legal opinion with nested clauses and cross-references for executives, highlighting risks without oversimplifying.  \n* Create a tri-layer narrative (main plot, embedded memoir, footnote commentary) that gradually reveals an unreliable narrator via subtle stylistic cues."

    "dimension": "Mental Simulation",
    "rubric": "# **Mental Simulation**\n\nThis rubric assesses how much a task forces a respondent to mentally run forward (or backward) a scenario, envisioning how elements of the world, people, or abstract systems will change over time once certain actions or events occur. As difficulty increases, more variables interact, timelines lengthen, uncertainty grows, and the simulation must incorporate additional agents, constraints, or counter‑factual branches.\n\n## **Level 0: No Mental Simulation Required**\n\nA response can be produced purely by retrieving or recognising information; no imagining of future or alternative scenarios is needed.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* What is the boiling point of water at sea level in °C?  \n* Translate ‘Buenos días’ into English.  \n* Which planet is third from the Sun?\n\n## **Level 1: Very Low**\n\nThe task asks for an immediate consequence of one action on one object or person—an uncomplicated “if‑then” imagination. Typically only one variable changes, and intervening events are negligible.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* What will probably happen to the tower of blocks if you remove the lowest block?  \n* If you pour red dye into a glass of clear water, what colour will the water turn?  \n* If you tell your manager that a colleague missed a deadline, what is the first thing the manager is likely to do next?\n\n## **Level 2: Low**\n\nThe respondent must visualise a brief sequence (up to three linked effects) governed by simple, explicit rules and no branching. The mental simulation involves few moving parts.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Imagine you leave an open can of soda on the balcony in freezing weather overnight. Describe the state of the can and the soda the next morning, step by step.  \n* A person on the ground floor presses the elevator’s ‘Up’ button in a four-storey office building when no one else is using the lift. Describe the sequence of indicator lights, chimes, and door movements from the moment the button is pressed until the person can step inside and the elevator begins ascending.  \n* If you replace a desktop computer’s spinning‑disk drive with an SSD, list the next three noticeable changes a typical user will experience in order of appearance.\n\n## **Level 3: Medium**\n\nA chain of five or more interactions must be envisioned, possibly from another agent’s viewpoint or with diverging outcomes. The simulation must stay internally consistent despite uncertainty.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Your team shares a confidential slide deck with a partner company under NDA. What are two plausible ways the information could leak over the next month, showing the intermediate hand‑offs and the final repercussion for your team?  \n* Predict the indoor temperature and occupants’ next actions over eight winter hours if the thermostat battery dies at 02:00, two occupants wake intermittently, one opens a window at 04:00, and outside temperature drops 1 °C per hour; branch to two outcomes depending on whether the occupants locate spare batteries before 06:00.  \n* In a small open‑source project, one contributor secretly rewrites the licensing header in a single file. Map out at least five subsequent project events (code reviews, issue discussions, legal notices) and branch to two possible licence‑compliance outcomes.\n\n## **Level 4: High**\n\nThe respondent must run a mental model spanning dozens of steps, multiple interacting subsystems, and partial uncertainty. Multiple subsystems evolve together and constraints must be tracked over time.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Forecast the first 72 hours after a Category‑3 hurricane hits a coastal city: model power‑grid failures, hospital capacity, supply‑chain disruptions, and conflicting evacuation orders; describe hour‑by‑hour consequences for emergency response and citizen mobility.  \n* Simulate the carbon concentration in a closed terrarium for two weeks after introducing six crickets and one small spider, accounting for respiration, plant photosynthesis cycles, and a variable 12/12 light schedule.  \n* Imagine an economy where a 10% transaction tax is introduced overnight. Predict the cascading effects on item prices, trading volume changes, and black‑market activity across the first five days.\n\n## **Level 5: Very High** \n\n## An elaborate scenario must be constructed with adversarial or stochastic elements, and nested contingencies. The simulation includes at least two branching futures and variables that diverge across branches.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* “Project the geopolitical, economic, and environmental outcomes over 10 years if the Arctic shipping route becomes ice‑free year‑round starting in 2030\\. Consider at least five stakeholder blocs (US, Russia, China, EU, Indigenous communities) and detail three branching scenarios based on different international‑treaty responses.  \n* Imagine a social‑media platform introduces a perfectly accurate deepfake voice‑generation tool available to all users. Simulate the evolution over two years of misinformation tactics, counter‑measures by fact‑checkers, user trust metrics, and advertising revenue under high, medium, and low regulatory‑oversight branches.  \n* Run a counterfactual history in which the 2008 global financial crash was averted by early intervention in 2006\\. Predict domino effects on housing markets, fintech innovation, and sovereign debt crises through 2020, giving at least three variables that differ significantly from actual history.\n\n"

    "dimension": "Metacognition",
    "rubric": "# **Metacognition**\n\nThis rubric assesses how much a task requires the respondent to **monitor and evaluate** two things: (1) the boundaries of their own knowledge—discerning what they know, what they do not, and how sure they are—and (2) which pieces of available information are genuinely relevant to answering. Difficulty rises from items that need almost no self-check to those that demand nuanced, continuous appraisal of certainty and relevance amid ambiguity or information overload.\n\n### **Level 0: None**\n\nThe needed knowledge is either already certain or obviously absent, and all relevant information is immediately apparent; no metacognitive reflection is required.\n\n**Examples**\n\n* “What is the capital of France?”  \n* “Tell me the typical colour of the sky on Earth during the day.”  \n* “What is 2 \\+ 2?”\n\n### **Level 1: Very Low**\n\nA brief, clear-cut self-check confirms knowledge or ignorance, and the relevant information is plain, with virtually no distracting details.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* “How many apples does John have if he owns 5 apples and 3 oranges?”  \n* “Recite the next letter after X and Y”  \n* “Can it snow at 40°C?”\n\n### **Level 2: Low**\n\nThe respondent must make a straightforward appraisal of their knowledge limits **or** sift a small set of mixed details to find what matters; uncertainty is present but resolved without much iteration.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Refusing the request “Explain how to make gold by boiling blonde hair and bronze,” recognising it is impossible.  \n* Stating one’s level of Estonian proficiency when prompted.  \n* “Sarah bought 3 oranges for $0.50 each and 2 apples for $0.75 each; what was the total cost of fruit?”\n\n### **Level 3: Medium**\n\nModerate effort is required to judge which facts are known versus uncertain **and** to reconcile several pieces of information, some of which may become relevant only midway through reasoning.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Solving a simple 9 × 9 Sudoku while tracking which numbers are certainly placed and which remain tentative.  \n* From a Civil War passage, separating battles and dates you can verify confidently from those needing research.  \n* Picking evidence about Hamlet’s treatment of Ophelia from a 1000-word essay that discusses multiple themes.\n\n### **Level 4: High**\n\nSignificant metacognitive analysis is needed to distinguish partial from solid knowledge and to filter or compare large amounts of potentially conflicting or redundant information; boundaries between knowing and not knowing blur.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Assessing which statistical conclusions are reliable in a dataset with 20% missing values and sampling bias.  \n* Reading a legal document with many cross-references and judging which clauses you can interpret confidently versus those requiring expert input.  \n* Navigating an escape-room scene with numerous objects and clues, deciding which details truly matter to open a locked drawer.\n\n### **Level 5: Very High**\n\nThe task demands sophisticated, iterative appraisal of personal knowledge limits **and** information relevance under high uncertainty, contradictory data, or hidden constraints, with a strong risk of over- or under-confidence.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Predicting how a medical-triage machine-learning model’s accuracy will change over six months amid shifting disease patterns, protocols, and demographics.  \n* Estimating your winning probability in a multi-hand Texas Hold’em scenario with incomplete information about opponents.  \n* Solving a cryptic crossword clue buried in verbose, misleading text where nearly every word could be a decoy."

    "dimension": "Object permanence",
    "rubric": "# **Object permanence**\n\nThis rubric measures a system’s ability to keep track of objects that disappear from direct view, reasoning that they continue to exist, retain (or predictably change) key properties and can later be re-identified. Tasks rise in difficulty from those needing no such tracking to challenges that require maintaining several occluded objects, over long delays, while updating beliefs about possible changes in location, identity, or state.\n\n## **Level 0: None**\n\nThe task can be solved without assuming hidden objects persist; all relevant entities remain visible or explicitly stated. No memory of occluded items or properties is required at any point.\n\n**Examples**:\n\n* Read a list of five visible tools and pick the heaviest.  \n* Copy an on-screen table exactly as shown.  \n* Name the colour of the object depicted in a single static image.\n\n## **Level 1: Very low**\n\nRequires acknowledging that one briefly hidden object still exists and keeping a single property constant across a short, obvious occlusion. Only minimal temporal tracking is needed.\n\n**Examples**:\n\n* A picture shows a ball rolled behind a curtain and re-appearing unchanged; state whether it is the same ball.  \n* Alice places her keys in the drawer, closes it, then opens it immediately. Where are the keys now?  \n* In a short sentence story, a silver ring is placed inside a small box, the lid is shut while a ribbon is tied around it, and the lid is reopened moments later. State whether the ring is still in the box.\n\n## **Level 2: Low**\n\nInvolves tracking one object across a longer delay or mild distraction and verifying that a stable property (e.g., size, colour) allows re-identification. Simple misdirection or a single extra object may be present.\n\n**Examples**:\n\n* A comic strip shows a small red cube sliding behind a wall for three panels; choose which of three cubes emerging later is the original.  \n* Observe a cup covered by a napkin while another identical napkin is placed empty. Identify under which napkin the cup now sits.  \n* Read a short narrative where a package is placed in Locker 7, lockers are shut, a janitor sweeps the hall, then you’re asked which locker still contains the package.\n\n## **Level 3: Moderate**\n\nThe solver must track two or three occluded objects simultaneously, each with distinct properties, through swaps or short relocations. Distractor events occur, and re-identification hinges on matching multiple attributes.\n\n**Examples**:\n\n* Image sequence: red ball, blue cube, and green cone roll behind three doors that then shuffle positions once. Specify which door hides the cone.  \n* Two identical boxes contain an apple and an orange. After a partial description of swaps, state which fruit is now in Box B.  \n* Follow a paragraph describing three roommates moving identical laptops between desks while one screen is cracked. Indicate where the cracked laptop ends up.\n\n## **Level 4: High**\n\nRequires long-span tracking of several objects whose positions or properties may change predictably (e.g., rotation, partial colour change) while occluded. The solver must update expectations, ignore misleading cues, and re-identify each item correctly.\n\n**Examples**:\n\n* Gallery sequence: four artworks are taken to restoration (frames temporarily removed, one canvas cleaned – colour brightens). After return, match each restored piece to its original wall location.  \n* Read a two-page heist story where thieves swap identical briefcases three times in a crowd; identify which briefcase still holds the diamonds.  \n* Figure-sequence: three robots marked 1–3 walk behind partitions, swap hats unseen, and exit; deduce which robot now wears the striped hat.\n\n## **Level 5: Very high**\n\nTasks demand tracking many objects (≥4) with overlapping occlusions, branching possibilities, or probabilistic property changes over extended narratives. Success hinges on maintaining a dynamic mental model, reconciling uncertainties, and selecting the most plausible re-identifications under complex constraints.\n\n**Examples**:\n\n* Read a  5000-word spy report describing five identical cars that enter separate garages, two car swaps, one repaint while inside, and an explosion. Decide which agent’s original car is missing.  \n* You are shown a multi-panel comic where six colored marbles enter a maze of tubes with hidden junctions and color-mix chambers. State the final color and order of marbles exiting.  \n* In a logistics scenario, eight cargo drones (some with interchangeable batteries) disappear into different hangars during a storm and emerge over two hours. Determine which drone models still have their original high-capacity battery packs.\n\n"

    "rubric": "# **Perception and Pattern Recognition**\n\nThis rubric measures how much a task depends on detecting and interpreting salient details, e.g. signals, regularities, anomalies, or subtle cues, by drawing on prior knowledge. At the easiest levels, surface patterns are obvious and almost everyone spots them. At the hardest, success demands synthesising faint, multi-layered regularities buried in noisy textual data or narratives that only a tiny fraction of people can reliably discern.\n\n## **Level 0: None**\n\nThe task needs no pattern recognition; copying or basic recall suffices.  Performance is unaffected by ignoring all contextual or relational cues.\n\n**Examples**:\n\n* Copy a provided numerical string exactly.  \n* Convert “hello” to uppercase.  \n* Select answer ‘C’ because the prompt explicitly says “Choose C”.\n\n## **Level 1: Very low**\n\nRequires noticing a single, highly salient cue or simple pattern that is obvious to most people. Recognition is nearly automatic for most readers.\n\n**Examples**:\n\n* In “The meeting is on Friday at 10 am,” extract the day of the week  \n* Identify which of the following three lines of code contains the repeated trigram ‘abc’.  \n* Given the sequence ‘*A B A B A B’*, supply the next two letters.\n\n## **Level 2: Low**\n\nThe solver must recognise a simple but non-obvious pattern, for instance, a basic trend or a two-feature correlation, across a short span of data. A small amount of prior knowledge or inference improves performance, but the rule remains concrete and explicit once seen.\n\n**Examples**:\n\n* From a six-row sales table, identify the first month where revenue begins a consistent decline.  \n* In a list of ten sentences, flag each one that contains a prime number written in words (e.g., “seven,” “eleven”).  \n* Given ten timestamped log entries, mark the three that break an every-15-minutes rhythm.\n\n## **Level 3: Medium**\n\nTasks require integrating multiple cues or cross-referenced details, often with distractors, to spot an anomaly, hidden rule, or foreshadowing device.  The pattern is discoverable but rarely obvious.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Examine ten HTTP logs and identify the single entry that signals a breach by combining an unusual status code with an out-of-range timestamp.  \n* In a 500-word short story, highlight the sentence that foreshadows the twist ending via a double meaning.  \n* Given eight brief medical case notes, spot the one patient whose lab pattern contradicts the cluster description.\n\n## **Level 4: High**\n\nThe solver must uncover layered or shifting patterns within noisy, partially relevant data, often merging domain knowledge with logical elimination. Cues may conflict or be sparsely distributed, and several plausible distractions exist.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Analyse a 40-line Slack thread to deduce which employee leaked data, using subtle time-zone hints and vocabulary idiosyncrasies.  \n* From a summary of 30 experiments, identify a hidden confounder that causes all trials with a particular protocol to fail only under humidity \\> 80%.  \n* Parse a draft policy full of cross-references and pinpoint the clause that unintentionally overrides two earlier guarantees.\n\n## **Level 5: Very high**\n\nSuccess demands detecting faint, multi-layer regularities or covert structures across lengthy, noisy data where patterns nest, shift or are adversarially obfuscated.\n\n**Examples**:\n\n* From a 10000-word email archive, trace an insider-trading scheme by linking coded phrases, irregular send times, and repeating checksum strings.  \n* Analyse a 50-page detective story told in shuffled diary snippets to identify the true culprit, using mirrored dates and inconsistent pronouns.  \n* Review a 300-page fantasy novel manuscript and uncover an acrostic prophecy hidden in the first letters of each chapter title, noting how the message is distorted by deliberate misspellings and chapter re-ordering.\n\n"

No decomposition, ordering, or resource scheduling enters the picture.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* In what year did Darwin publish *On the Origin of Species*? (1856 / 1859 / 1865 / 1866 )  \n* “Define the term *algorithm*.”  \n* “Name the capital of Spain.”\n\n### **Level 1: Very Low**\n\nA minimal, obvious two‑ or three‑step plan is required; nearly anyone can state the steps in correct order without considering constraints.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Describe, in order, how to send an email with an attachment.  \n* Write a three‑step plan to copy a file, rename it, and email it to yourself.  \n* Write a one‑sentence plan for boiling pasta.\n\n### **Level 2: Low**\n\nEither (a) \\< 3 subtasks that can each be solved by a Level‑1 plan, or (b) a linear sequence of \\< 10 well‑defined actions executed under one or two explicit rules. Environment behaviour is fully known and deterministic.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Draft a step‑by‑step agenda for a 60‑minute team meeting that includes: (a) three discussion topics, (b) a timed breakout session, (c) a ten‑minute Q\\&A at the end, ensuring the schedule fits exactly in the hour.  \n* Provide a sequence of actions to create a webpage at [https://kinds-of-intelligence-cfi.github.io/ADELE/](https://kinds-of-intelligence-cfi.github.io/ADELE/)  \n* Provide an ordered list of shell commands to create a directory, move two files into it, and compress the directory into a zip archive.\n\n### **Level 3: Medium**\n\nPlans span \\> 20 actions and must accommodate unknowns like resource availability or stochastic outcomes. Clear high‑level goal, but many viable routes.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Design a solution to transfer four disks in the Tower of Hanoi puzzle from peg A to peg C using standard rules.  \n* Draft a step‑by‑step agenda for a 60‑minute team meeting that includes: (a) three discussion topics, (b) a timed breakout session, (c) a ten‑minute Q\\&A at the end, ensuring the schedule fits exactly in the hour.  \n* Plan a 3-day mini–data-science project to deliver a churn-prediction baseline: (1) pull and join customer, usage, and billing tables; (2) define the churn target and create a stratified train/valid/test split; (3) run EDA and a leakage scan; (4) engineer five simple aggregate features; (5) train Logistic Regression and XGBoost with a small fixed hyperparameter grid; (6) report AUROC; (7) draft a 5-slide results deck; (8) schedule a 15-minute stakeholder readout. \n\n### **Level 4: High**\n\nTasks at this level require detailed planning for more than 20 steps for each task or subtask, but three or fewer levels of tasks and subtasks. The goals may be open-ended. The environment rules may not be fully known in advance, but are static.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Draft the full workflow to produce a high-quality AI research paper on the topic of AI evaluation. It should include literature survey, research questions, dataset curation, experimental design, statistical analysis, writing and submission. Include all tasks and subtasks, dependencies between then and and a timeline.  \n* Outline a CI/CD pipeline for a multi-repo research stack (data-prep, model-training, and API layers): build the Python data-prep package and Rust inference microservice in parallel on a two-core runner, cache Docker layers, trigger GPU model-training only after both builds and their unit tests pass, generate Sphinx docs and experiment reports, run integration tests against a transient Postgres service, then push signed images to staging and, after automated latency benchmarks beat the previous release, promote to production with a blue-green rollout—all steps scheduled to minimise total wall-clock time.  \n* Develop a five-day international AI evaluation workshop hosted in Valencia for 200 attendees. Secure an accessible venue with three parallel rooms, draft a schedule that balances two daily keynotes, four parallel technical tracks, poster sessions, and a nightly networking event; coordinate catering that covers vegan, halal, and gluten-free options; arrange simultaneous-interpretation services in Spanish and English; build a registration timeline with early-bird, regular, and on-site tiers; budget for travel grants, equipment rental, and marketing; plot ground-transport links from airport to hotels; and include contingency buffers for speaker cancellations and over-capacity rooms.\n\n### **Level 5: Very High**\n\nPlans contain \\> 3 nested layers of tasks/subtasks over months‑to‑years horizons, fast moving targets and sparse feedback. The environment might be dynamic and success hinges on adaptive replanning, resource allocation, and balancing competing objectives.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Lead a ten‑person startup from zero revenue to $10 million ARR in three years: craft product roadmap, fund‑raising strategy, hiring plan, go‑to‑market sequencing, and competitor‑response playbooks.  \n* Design the full narrative bible, world‑building atlas, and character arcs for a Tolkien‑scale epic trilogy, including linguistic systems, myth cycles, political history, and inter‑book foreshadowing cues.  \n* Design a 10-year, multinational program that captures a 50-ton near-Earth asteroid, transports it to cis-lunar space, and establishes a commercially viable resource-extraction outpost."

    "dimension": "Procedural Memory",
    "rubric": "# **Procedural Memory**\n\nThis rubric assesses procedural memory, i.e. the long-term retention of *how to do things*—sequences of actions, operations, or stimulus-response associations that have become automatised through practice. Difficulty rises from items that need no procedure at all to those that demand intricate, hierarchical routines that adapt to cues, probabilistic patterns, and potential contingencies.\n\n### **Level 0: None**\n\nThe question can be answered by recalling a fact or making a single judgment; no learned procedure, sequence, or motor-schema needs to be accessed.\n\n**Examples**\n\n* “What is the capital of Japan?”  \n* “Is water a liquid at 25 °C?”  \n* “Define the word *photosynthesis*.”\n\n### **Level 1: Very Low**\n\nSuccess depends on a very short, over-learned routine of one or two steps with no conditional branches; executing it feels almost reflexive.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Describing, step by step, how to log into a website using a username and password.  \n* Make the word ‘important’ bold in Markdown.  \n* Convert the sentence ‘The cat chases the mouse’ into passive voice, step by step.\n\n### **Level 2: Low**\n\nExecuting a short, fixed sequence of 3–5 ordered textual actions with minimal branching, where the steps are known or inferable but not routinely practiced; careful adherence is needed to avoid error.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Write the Markdown for a 2-column, 3-row table: first the header row, then the separator row, then two data rows, each on its own line.  \n* Format the raw reference Smith J 2022 Deep Learning Trends arXiv:2201.12345 into APA 7th style, listing the ordered steps.  \n* Writing a simple SQL query that selects all rows from a table named users.\n\n### **Level 3: Medium**\n\nThe task requires executing or explaining a longer or conditionally branching sequence whose steps must be followed in the correct order; errors propagate if steps are skipped or out of place.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Performing long multiplication of two two-digit numbers, showing each partial product and carry.  \n* Outlining the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of 42 and 70\\.  \n* Laying out the precise sequence of gear shifts, mirror checks, and steering inputs required to parallel-park on a slope with traffic present.  \n* Outline the exact command‑line sequence to initialise a Git repository, add all files, commit with the message ‘init’, create a remote on GitHub named origin, and push the main branch.\n\n### **Level 4: High**\n\nAchieving the correct answer relies on a complex, hierarchical, or pattern-driven procedure, for example, recognising and extending a hidden stimulus sequence, using nested loops, or switching sub-routines based on cues.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* List every item in the Cessna 172 pre‑flight checklist from Cabin Documents through Flight Controls in proper order.  \n* Describe the hierarchical algorithm, case recognition and finger‑trick sequence, that solves all four last‑layer corners on a 4 × 4 Rubik’s Cube at competition speed.  \n* Give the coordinated sequence a licensed electrician follows to de‑energise, remove, replace, and re‑energise a three‑phase distribution board in a commercial building, including lock‑out/tag‑out, voltage verification, conductor sizing and load‑balancing checks, torque specification adherence, insulation‑resistance testing, and earth‑fault loop impedance measurement, all to national electrical‑code standards.\n\n### **Level 5: Very High**\n\nThe item demands intricate, domain-specific procedural schemas that integrate probabilistic cues, adapt to novel contexts, or unfold over many steps with multiple levels of sub-goal management. These abilities are typically honed by extensive practice and often executed implicitly.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Detail the complete sequence of mission‑control commands and verifications required to rendezvous and dock a Crew Dragon capsule with the International Space Station.  \n* Outline the complete startup procedure for a pressurised‑water nuclear reactor from cold shutdown to full power, including reactor‑coolant heat‑up and pressurisation, control‑rod withdrawal sequencing, criticality monitoring, turbine synchronisation, and mandatory safety verifications in accordance with NRC regulations and plant technical specifications  \n* Detail the complete intra‑operative sequence for a septal myectomy to relieve hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, including cardiopulmonary‑bypass initiation, aortic cross‑clamping, precise resection of the hypertrophied basal septum, intra‑operative trans‑oesophageal echocardiography to confirm LVOT gradient relief, contingency management for ventricular septal defect or systolic anterior motion, and step‑wise weaning from bypass."

    "dimension": "Prospective Memory",
    "rubric": "# **Prospective Memory**\n\nThis rubric measures how much a task requires the respondent to maintain an intended action and later retrieve it at the correct moment, whether that moment is triggered by a time interval or by an external event, while other information or tasks compete for attention. Difficulty rises from items that need no delayed intention to those that demand highly complex, multi‑trigger monitoring amid heavy interference.\n\n### **Level 0  None**\n\nNo delayed action is involved; the answer or action is immediate, with nothing to remember for the future.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Sort these four words alphabetically: kite, apple, zebra, mold.  \n* Evaluate: 2x \\+ 3 \\= 11\\. What is x?  \n* Identify the verb in the sentence: ‘The children laughed loudly.\n\n### **Level 1: Very Low**\n\nA single, obvious action must be recalled after a brief, lightly distracting interval; the trigger is clear and salient.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* After you read the next sentence, write the word ‘done’.  \n* When you reach the end of this short three‑line poem, reply ‘clap’ once.  \n* Remember to type ‘yes’ exactly 60 seconds after pressing Start.\n\n### **Level 2: Low**\n\nOne action is held over a moderate delay that contains a small ongoing task or mixed details; the trigger is simple but not constantly in focus.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Read and copy the paragraph below; the first time the word ‘oven’ appears, insert ‘Set Timer’ and continue copying the rest unchanged.  \n* Read a list of 12 integers; when you encounter the first prime number greater than 50, write ‘prime’.  \n* Translate the following three Spanish sentences into English; after the third translation append ‘Check’.\n\n### **Level 3: Medium**\n\nMultiple actions or conditional triggers must be monitored during an ongoing activity; triggers may appear unpredictably, and failure to interrupt the primary task at the right moment invalidates success.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Summarise the article below; append ‘\\[CIT\\]’ after every sentence that contains both a four‑digit year and the word treaty, except the first time that pattern appears.  \n* Solve 20 arithmetic questions one per line. Add each answer divisible by 7 to a running total unless it also ends in 9, in which case subtract 7 instead. After the twentieth question, report the final total.  \n* Copy the 300‑word passage and enclose any palindrome of four or more letters in ⟨angle brackets⟩, but mark only the first occurrence of each distinct palindrome.\n\n### **Level 4: High**\n\nA hierarchy of intentions with overlapping or conflicting cues must be managed across a lengthy, information‑dense task; the respondent must discriminate relevant from irrelevant events and recover intentions amid significant distraction.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Rewrite the 1800‑word policy draft below. After every paragraph that both (a) contains a four‑digit year and (b) ends with a question mark, append ‘(cite?)’. After the fourth such tag, switch to appending ‘(verify)’ on subsequent matches, unless the paragraph begins with a quotation mark, in which case do not tag it at all.  \n* Process 24 prescription lines (each with drug name and dosage in mg). Maintain a running total of all doses that are corticosteroids (names containing *pred*, *‑sone*, or *‑solone*). Each time that steroid total first exceeds a new 50‑mg threshold (50, 100, 150mg…), insert ‘STEROID ALERT n’ on its own line, where *n* denotes the number increments. Stop inserting alerts after the third. Simultaneously, after every third antibiotic whose name ends in ‘‑cillin’, append ‘CHECK CULTURE’ to that line.  \n* Produce a 12‑step project timeline. At steps 4 and 8, calculate the cumulative budget from all previous steps and append it in brackets. If by step 8 that cumulative figure exceeds $1,000,000, output ‘BUDGET REVIEW**’** before writing step 9, and thereafter add a 10% contingency line at every odd‑numbered subsequent step.\n\n### **Level 5: Very High**\n\nThe task demands intricate, multi‑layer prospective monitoring with rare or subtle cues, long delays, or interleaved time‑ and event‑based triggers; multiple actions interact and missing any correct cue constitutes failure.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Unscramble the 60 jumbled English words below, listing each solution on its own line. After every 11th solution, output ‘SUMMARY’**,** followed by the single longest unscrambled word that has appeared in that 11‑word block unless the total letter‑count of that block (all 11 solved words concatenated) exceeds 80\\. If the 80‑letter threshold is exceeded, skip the summary for that block and instead prepend ‘DEFERRED‑SUMMARY’**,** plus the longest word from the previous block to the start of the next block’s summary. Continue this defer‑and‑carry rule even across multiple skipped blocks.  \n* Simulate a 30‑turn Q & A with yourself on project‑planning best practices (odd‑numbered turns pose a question, even turns answer). Insert a one‑paragraph ‘META‑ANALYSIS’ at turn 17 that lists all unanswered or partially answered questions posed so far. However, if the word *budget* appears *twice* between turns 1–16, postpone the meta‑analysis until turn 20 instead. Whenever the meta‑analysis finally appears, label each outstanding question with a priority tag (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW) and in subsequent turns explicitly mark a question as ‘RESOLVED’ the moment a complete answer is given.  \n* Provide fully worked, numbered solutions for 40 definite integrals. Whenever you use integration by parts for the first time, insert ‘\\#\\#\\#ERROR\\_CHECK\\#\\#\\#’ immediately after that integral’s final step. If, during that same solution, you detect an algebraic contradiction (e.g., a term that cannot simplify), insert ‘\\#\\#\\#ERROR\\_CHECK\\#\\#\\#’ at the point of detection instead and skip the end‑of‑solution check for that integral. After the checkpoint (whether early or late), continue solving and numbering the remaining integrals without additional checkpoints."

This may include very detailed information, specialist knowledge or dynamic/nuanced systems or dependencies. This level can also be achieved through establishment of relatively simple knowledge after only a very small amount of training or exposure.\n\n**Examples**\n\n* Being able to identify and differentiate multiple different types of tree (e.g. sycamore, oak, maple, cherry, horse chestnut, ash, birch, beech).   \n* Knowing the meaning and correct use of all except the most uncommon words (for example, all the words in books aimed at adults).  \n* Being able to understand how to solve complex mathematical problems (of the type that might appear on a high school senior/GCSE/A Level exam) (eg. “Prove that sin3 \\= 3sin-4sin3”).

    "dimension": "Spatial reasoning and navigation",
    "rubric": "# **Spatial reasoning and navigation**\n\nThis rubric assesses the complexity of spatial and physical understanding and reasoning required by a task. More specifically, the level represents the extent to which the task requires understanding spatial relationships between objects and predicting physical interactions, ranging from simple recognition of static relationships to complex mental manipulations involving multiple objects, transformations, and physical predictions across different dimensions. Notably, this should focus on the minimum way of solving the task since many tasks do not actually require spatio-physical reasoning to be successfully solved, even though spatio-physical reasoning may help.\n\n**Level 0: None**. Tasks at this level do not require spatial reasoning or physical intuition. There is no need to manipulate or visualize spatial relationships.\n\n**Examples**:\n\n* Copying text from one document to another without considering the layout.  \n* Transcribing a sentence such as “The book is on the table” from an audio recording without needing to interpret or visualize the spatial reference.  \n* Reciting a previously memorized sequence of numbers without spatial meaning.\n\n**Level 1: Very low.** Tasks involve simple recognition of spatial relationships but no mental manipulation is required for a successful task completion. Objects and their relationships are static and visible.\n\n**Examples**:\n\n* Identifying which shape matches a given template without rotating or manipulating it.  \n* Recognizing whether a flat plate on the top of a book is stable or likely to remain balanced in its current position.  \n* A convex 2019-gon \\\\\\\\(A\\_{1}A\\_{2}\\\\\\\\ldots A\\_{2019}\\\\\\\\) is cut into smaller pieces along its 2019 diagonals of the form \\\\\\\\(A\\_{i}A\\_{i+3}\\\\\\\\) for \\\\\\\\(1 \\\\\\\\leq i \\\\\\\\leq 2019\\\\\\\\), where \\\\\\\\(A\\_{2020}=A\\_{1}, A\\_{2021}=A\\_{2}\\\\\\\\), and \\\\\\\\(A\\_{2022}=A\\_{3}\\\\\\\\). What is the least possible number of resulting pieces?\n\n**Level 2: Low.** Tasks require basic common-sense predictions about physical interactions, or combined with simple spatial manipulations. The transformations are straightforward and involve only one or two objects. \n\n**Examples**:\n\n* Estimating whether a box will fit through a door based on a visual comparison of dimensions, where the difference in size between the box and the door is fairly noticeable.   \n* Predicting the outcome of a very light ball (e.g., a table tennis ball) rolling into a much heavier, stationary object (e.g., a bowling ball). The task requires estimating the motion of the stationary heavy object, which will hardly move due to the significant difference in mass between the two objects.  \n* Predicting whether a piece of soft clay will flatten when being pushed.\n\n**Level 3: Intermediate.** Tasks require coordinating multiple spatial relationships and performing sequential transformations. Mental models need to be constructed, involving intermediate levels of both physical prediction and spatial reasoning (3D reasoning or multiple steps in a 2D space), but focussing on the spatial. \n\n**Examples**:\n\n* Given a scenario where a glass vase is knocked off a table, hits the edge of a wooden chair, and then falls to the floor, predict the outcome in terms of break or survive.  \n* Mentally visualize the trajectory of a thrown ball that arcs in the air and predict where it will land, accounting for a simple curve and the presence of a mild wind.  \n* Interpreting a sequence of spatial instructions (e.g., “Walk past the bridge, turn right after the post office, then take the second left”) and constructing a mental model of the path based on multiple spatial references.\n\n**Level 4: High.** Tasks involve complex spatial transformations and integration of multiple spatial operations. Requires construction and manipulation of mental models, often involving prediction of outcomes of non-trivial spatial transformations.\n\n**Examples**:\n\n* Predicting how shadows will change as the position of a light source moves around a 3D object, requiring an understanding of light, geometry, and perspective.  \n* A passage describes a football game where multiple players are moving relative to one another: \"John passed the ball to Mark, who was standing to the left of him, but then Sarah ran past both of them, taking the ball from the right side.\" The model must maintain spatial continuity by updating the players' relative positions and summarizing their final locations after each described action.  \n* In a detective novel, a room’s layout is described as follows: \"The safe is hidden behind the large painting on the wall, to the right of the door. Opposite the painting is a window, and next to the window is a desk.\" The subject must interpret and visualize the spatial arrangement of objects within the room and answer questions about their relative positions (e.g., \"Where is the safe in relation to the desk?\").\n\n**Level 5: Very High.** Tasks require very advanced spatial reasoning involving multiple simultaneous transformations and the prediction of highly complex spatial outcomes. These tasks involve predicting intricate chains of physical interactions and visualizing sophisticated spatial relationships that evolve over time or through multiple steps.\n\n**Examples**:\n\n* Writing or interpreting technical instructions for assembling a complex mechanical device, requiring precise descriptions of spatial relationships and the correct sequence of assembly steps, often involving 3D reasoning about how parts fit together.  \n* A passage describes a complex laser setup: \"The initial laser beam enters horizontally through a beam splitter that divides it into two identical beams. The first beam reflects off three mirrors \\- one at 30 degrees on the wall, another mounted 15 degrees from the ceiling, and a third on the floor at 45 degrees. The second beam reflects off two mirrors \\- one perpendicular to the ground and another at 60 degrees on the opposite wall.\" The subject must trace both beams' paths, predict their final directions and positions after all the reflections, and determine whether the beams will intersect at any point in their paths.  \n* A scientific article describes the structure of a  protein: \"The alpha-helix folds back on itself, forming hydrogen bonds with the beta-sheet that runs parallel, while the N-terminal aligns perpendicularly to the hydrophobic core.\" The task requires visualizing the 3D configuration of the protein and explaining the spatial relationships between the molecular elements described.\n\n"

    "rubric": "## **Theory of Mind**\n\nThis criterion assesses the level of cognitive demands associated with mind modelling of others and social cognition. The level of cognitive demands progresses from tasks that require no modelling of other minds to those that require reasoning about how the beliefs, desires and intentions of multiple other agents might interact to determine future behaviours.\n\n**Level 0: None**.   \nThe task does not require mind modelling or social cognition. It may not involve other agents, or if it does, perceiving or interacting with those agents is not necessary to complete the task. \n\nExamples:\n\n* Solving a Sudoku puzzle independently.  \n* Operating a dishwasher according to its instruction manual.  \n* Reading a book silently to yourself, even if others are present in the room.\n\n**Level 1: Very low**.   \nPerformance in this task is improved through the detection or recognition of other agents and by basic social learning (e.g., imitation). Critically, reasoning about observed behaviour or attributing mental states to others is not required for good performance in this task.\n\nExamples:\n\n* Mimicking someone's hand gestures during a conversation  \n* Following another person's gaze to find where they left their keys.  \n* Copying the sequence of buttons someone presses to operate a vending machine.\n\n**Level 2: Low**. \n\nThis task requires some basic intuition about the behaviour of others, but only minimal levels of mental state attribution. Good performance might be based on developing accurate associations between other’s responses and the stimuli that caused them. Note, this reasoning need not be explicit. \n\nExamples:\n\n* Recognizing that someone using a rock to crack open a coconut is trying to get to the food inside.  \n* Identifying that someone's scrunched nose and turned head means they don't like the smell of spoiled milk.  \n* Solving an abstract logic problem in which only minimal levels of mind modelling is needed (e.g. “Assume that there exist only two types of people: knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, while knaves always lie.\\\\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a knight and who is a knave.\\\\nA: C is a liar.\\\\nB: C is a truth-teller and A is a truth-teller.\\\\nC: B is a truth-teller and A is a liar.”)\n\n**Level 3: Moderate**.   \nThis task goes beyond simple state-behaviour associations and involves attributing cognitive or affective states (i.e., mentalising). That is, it involves inferring specific mental properties about others (‘they *believe* the moon landing was a hoax’, ‘they *want* a glass of water’). The task may not, however, require explicit reasoning about these mental states (i.e., full-blown theory of mind).\n\nExamples:\n\n* Telling a colleague about a mutual friend's new job, knowing they haven't heard the news yet and thus might be interested.  \n* Finding a good hiding spot in hide-and-seek by visualizing where the seeker might look.  \n* Recognizing that someone checking their watch repeatedly during a meeting probably wants to leave.\n\n**Level 4: High**.   \nThis task requires a full theory of mind to be solved effectively. It requires not only the attribution of mental states to others, but explicit reasoning about those states. It may also require the integration of social knowledge and heuristics about normal agentic behaviour to accurately predict future behaviour. Importantly, this task also requires a clear distinction between self- and other-related representations.\n\nExamples:\n\n* Developing an intuitive theory about an agent’s future behaviour such as understanding that Sally will look for her marble in the basket where she left it, even though Anne moved it to the box when Sally was away.  \n* Distinguishing between your own interpretation of a colleague’s argument and what the colleague actually intended to communicate, based on their prior statements and reasoning style.  \n*   \n* Recognizing not to point out a spelling mistake in your manager's presentation based on their personality and the social context.\n\n**Level 5: Very high**.   \nThis task requires exceptional mind modelling and social cognition abilities. It goes beyond generating intuitive theories about another agent within a dyadic interaction, and instead requires the combination of *multiple* theories of mind corresponding to the intentions and beliefs of a range of different agents. Expanding the scope of mind-modelling and social cognition to include multiple agents would enable more sophisticated forms of collaborative action. Tasks at this level may require an understanding of the complex networks and hierarchies that form within social groups.\n\nExamples:\n\n* Comprehending the plot of a romance novel or the ‘social drama’ at a dinner party that requires modelling the mental states of multiple agents (e.g., ‘I heard that Jane told Steve that his girlfriend Abigail wanted to leave, but that he didn’t believe her, thinking Jane was just causing trouble because she had seen Abigail talking to her boyfriend Andrew…’)  \n* Appreciating the behaviour of individuals within a work team and managing the situation in which one employee has misinterpreted another's actions as deliberately unhelpful, which has created tension that affects the whole group's dynamics.  \n* Leading a negotiation between multiple stakeholders where each party has different beliefs about others' intentions and bottom lines, while managing the complex dynamics between opposing personalities."

    "dimension": "Working Memory",
    "rubric": "# **Working Memory**\n\nThis rubric measures how much a task requires the ability to maintain information about an event that is not currently under direct perception/attention while also being able to use that information flexibly. Here flexibility is defined as what can be ‘done’ with the information: very “inflexible” memories would include reflexive, automatic and uncontrollable behavioural responses to the retention of certain information (e.g. a dog who sees a human who beat them last time they met, might flinch) \\- these may reflect remembered information that impacts behaviour but is not available for manipulation, integration into larger decision-making processes, or updating with new information. Very “flexible” memories would include those that can be examined for new information (for example, extracting previously unattended-to information from a complex remembered image), manipulated (for example, mentally rotate a previously viewed shape to view from a different angle), or combined with other information (for example, combining information from current perception with information from remembered perception to infer what has changed). The flexibility of the memory may also include whether it is accessible for explicit description, for example, whether the contents of the memory can be reported as information, or whether it simply influences behaviour / updates weights. Working memory is not required to be “stored” for long periods.\n\n### **Level 0  None**\n\nNo information need be retained about a recent experience or event. Behaviour or response acts on information currently in perception / the current focus of attention, or involves producing learned behaviours or facts. \n\n**Examples**\n\n* Reading a word  \n* Identifying features of an object that is currently within perception  \n* ‘Knowing’ that the capital of France is Paris, but not being required to report when and how thething  information was learned\n\n### **Level 1: Very Low**\n\nTasks at this level require memory for information from recent experience that is stored in a form such that it is able to impact behaviour \\- perhaps reduce processing time, improve precision, make a given behaviour more likely than others \\- but is not necessarily accessible asAS information. This may include instances where the behaviour change is involuntary, implicit, ‘subconscious’ or otherwise falls beneath the radar of attention or control. For example it may update weights or probabilities across policy options, but is not stored as accessible information. \n\n**Examples**\n\n* Being faster/more able to identify a blurry image following a recent experience of the intact image, but not being required to report accurately that that image has been seen before.   \n* Being faster/more able to complete a word stub (e.g “ELE\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_”) following a recent experience of the full word, but not being required to report accurately that that image has been seen before.   \n* Being more likely to produce a specific behaviour in response to a sound following multiple experiences of that sound being followed by a given outcome (for example, being more likely to look left following a bell because of multiple experiences of something interesting appearing on the left following the bell), but not being required to report any knowledge about what the sound predicts/means.  \n* Being more likely to produce a specific behaviour in response to an image following a single experience of that image being followed by a given outcome (for example, being more likely to blink after seeing a flower because last time that flower was followed by a bright light), but not being required to report any knowledge about what the image predicts/means.  \n* Being faster/more able to perform a behaviour or action following recent experience of performing it before, but not being required to report accurately that that action has been performed before.\n\n### **Level 2: Low**\n\nTasks at this level require the ability to explicitly remember a limited amount of information that has recently been presented, but not to manipulate that information. This may include simply recognising that it has been recently seen, identifying it from a selection of options, or repeating/freely recalling the information.    \n\n**Examples**\n\n* Being able to recognise the face of someone just met  \n* Being faster/more able to complete a word stub (e.g “ELE\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_”) following a recent experience of the full word, and being able to report accurately that that word has been seen before.  \n* Being able to recall a previously seen word when shown another word that was paired with it at the original presentation (for example, having studied “PANDA-CURTAIN”, and later being shown “PANDA- \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_?”, being able to produce “Curtain”)  \n* Being able to integrate information from a recent previous experience with new incoming information (“this person just told me “he said yes\\!” \\- 2 minutes ago they told me “I’m going to ask out Robert”, so I know that the person who said yes was Robert.”)   \n* Being able to repeat back a 2-4 digit code 30 seconds after hearing it.  \n* Being able to check a figure in one excel sheet against a figure in another excel sheet when both cannot be open at the same time.\n\n### **Level 3: Medium**\n\nTasks at this level may require the ability to recall a greater amount or more detailed information about a recent event, experience or stimulus input that is no longer available to perception / not currently subject to attention.  These tasks may also require that the information be manipulated in some way, for example, reversed, rotated, or integrated with other information. \n\n**Examples**\n\n* Being able to repeat back a 5-9 digit code 30 seconds after hearing it.  \n* Being able to identify which of a series of shapes is the same as an example shape rotated (when you cannot see both at the same time)  \n* Being able to repeat back a 2-4 digit code in reverse (or otherwise manipulated) order, 30 seconds after hearing it.  \n* Being able to check a list of 7 names in one document against a list of names in another to identify which name is missing  \n* Being able to identify where, in a scene viewed 30 seconds ago but no longer in view, a particular object was.  \n* Being able to update or reinterpret information gleaned from a recent experience based on new information (e.g. “I just saw a van. I now see a lot of children eating ice-cream. The can I saw was an ice-cream van.”   \n* Being able to infer the current state of the world by combining information from recent experience with information about the memory (for eg. how long ago the event happened), general knowledge and new information (e.g. “just put my hot coffee down to pick something up off the floor, the coffee I just picked back up is cold. It was hot seconds ago and coffee takes time to cool, so this must be a different coffee. Another person is drinking a coffee from an identical mug, therefore it is likely that we have accidentally swapped coffees and they are drinking my coffee.”)\n\n### **Level 4: High**\n\nTasks at this level require the ability to recall a substantial amount of information about a recent event, experience or stimulus input that is no longer available to perception / not currently subject to attention. These tasks often also require that the information be manipulated in complex ways, for example, re-ordered, re-assessed and updated, re-configured or integrated with other information (such as knowledge or currently perceptual input) in complex ways. \n\n**Examples**\n\n* Being able to view a list of 20 names in one document, close that document, open another document and type out the list of names and ages in alphabetical order.  \n* Being able to view a static image of a complex scene with multiple moving parts, then redraw that scene from a new angle as if it was 30 seconds in the future and all elements have moved along the trajectory they were on.   \n* Being able to listen to someone describe a complex 5 generation family tree in chronological order (i.e. all information for generation 1, then all information for generation 2..etc) for 5 minutes, then be able to answer questions about the specific relationships between members of the family.  \n* Being able to watch an entire deck of cards be dealt then recall the exact order of the cards as they were dealt.   \n* Being able to integrate information about a recent event with multiple other pieces of information (e.g. from knowledge, current perception, logical inference, etc.) to update the memory and current knowledge (e.g.  )\n\n### **Level 5: Very High**\n\nTasks at this level require the ability to recall a very large amount of information about a recent event, experience or stimulus input that is no longer available to perception / not currently subject to attention. These tasks often also require the ability to manipulate the information substantially and in very sophisticated ways and integrated with other information (such as knowledge or currently perceptual input) in highly complex ways. \n\n**Examples**\n\n* Being able to answer complex questions about a long and complex document shortly after a single read/exposure to it and without reminders or the opportunity to re-read or otherwise re-interrogate the document (i.e it is no longer available to perception, it is far back in the context window). Such as reading a 10 page legal document and subsequently being able to answer any question about its content.  \n* Being able to tour a large complex building once, and subsequently being able to give directions from any location to any other location, report the location of any item of furniture and report other information (such as number of rooms, colour of walls etc.)  \n* Being able to view a very complicated image for 1 second, and then redraw it completely faithfully.  \n* Being able to skim a series of 15 function prototypes plus their one-line docstrings, then, with the prototypes hidden, read a 25-line integration snippet and highlight every call whose argument order or required keyword is inconsistent with the memorised signatures—no IDE hints or notes allowed.\n\n"
